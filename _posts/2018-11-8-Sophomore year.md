# The Second Year of High school

I would say that the second year of high school was kind of the same as my freshman year but I would say it was better than my freshman year. In the sophomore year I was beginning to step out of the "shell" I have created around me during the freshman year, I started trying to speak out more often and trying to adjust into this change I was trying to achieve and throught the year I was getting better and better at it, but I was still a little nervous so it was hard for me at this point.
