# I am excited to attend college

I am excited to be attending Metro State in the following year of 2019. What makes me excited to attend college is that I know how important it is for my mom that I go to college and pursue the career of my choice. It is a good feeling knowing that once my mom sees me go off to college she will be proud of my accomplishments. Attending a university is a going to be a big step in the right direction into be working the career that I want.  

> College is the reward for surviving high school.

# Why I chose Metro State over any other college

I decided to choose Metropolitan State University of Denver over any other college because I knew that Metro was the closest university to home and I knew that for college I didn’t want to go far away to school. After doing some more research I found out that Metro is the cheapest university in the state of Colorado which is better for me, since I wouldn’t be thousands and thousands of dollars in debt.
