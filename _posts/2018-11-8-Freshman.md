## Entering High School

   Entering high school was kind of a fascinating experience for me. I say fascinating because going from middle school and into freshman year of high school was kind of a big step for me. I guess you can say that I was one of those "shy" students went I entered the 9th grade because I didn't really speak much or really participate in class since I just felt way too nervous to step out of the "shell" that I have created around me. I felt that if I said the wrong thing or asked what seemed like a dumb quetions I would be made fun of for the rest of school year. Yes, I know that may sound a bit too dramatic but that's what I actually felt at the time and looking back at it now I find it kind of funny for even thinking stuff like that.
