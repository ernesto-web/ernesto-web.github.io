## Entering High School

Entering high school was kind of a fascinating experience for me. I said fascinating because going from middle school and into freshman year of high school was kind of a big step for me. I guess you can say that I was one of those shy students because I didn't really speak much or reall participate in school activities since I just felt way too nervous for me to step out of "shell" that I have created around me.
