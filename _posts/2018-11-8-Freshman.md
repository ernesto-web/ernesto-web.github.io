## Entering High School

   Entering high school was kind of a fascinating experience for me. I say fascinating because going from middle school and into freshman year of high school was kind of a big step for me. I guess you can say that I was one of those "shy" students went I entered the 9th grade because I didn't really speak much or really participate in class since I just felt way too nervous to step out of the "shell" that I have created around me. I felt that if I said the wrong thing or asked what seemed like a dumb questions I would be made fun of for the rest of school year. Yes, I know that may sound a bit too dramatic but that's what I actually felt at the time and looking back at it now I find it kind of funny for even thinking stuff like that. 

## Getting Through High School

	Getting through high school was not difficult but at the sametime it was not easy. What made it kind of hard was the typical homework that each teacher decides for some reason to assign on the same day and due on the same day. This was the only difficult part of high school I would say, other than that high school was pretty easy during my freshman year, I didn’t really care about making friends or having to speak to people. I was more of a person that would just keep to himself and not care about having a ton of friends or trying to be the popular one because at the end of high school your high school status doesn’t matter to anyone else but yourself.
