# Newest Iphone
The Iphone XS Max was Apple's newest release this year and the improvements have been astonishing from the past iphone 8. The screen has been improved and made larger in order for more to be displayed. Also, the new iphone has also recieved a larger battery compared to the latest iphone 8. 

## The Pros
The pros of having this new phone is that there is a lot more screen for the owner of the phone to enjoy. Having a larger screen means that there is more of the image being displayed at a higher resolution. This also means that a larger screen equals and larger battery therefore, the battery life of the phone has been increased and will have more "juice" to operate longer. This also means that compact phones have a compact battery that is much smaller than a phone that has a big screen.

## The Cons
The cons of this new iphone is that the size has also been made larger than the iphone X. This means that this phone has been made as large as the iphone 8 plus, which can be a problem for people who have small hands or like to be able to operate the phone with just one hand.
